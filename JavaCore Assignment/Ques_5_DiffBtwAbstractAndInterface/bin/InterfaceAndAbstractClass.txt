*Interface
1.Interface is a contract that specifies set of abstract methods which must be implemented 
by the child Concrete Class.
2.Interface can be Defined by using the keyword 'interface'.
3.In java Interface is manly used for defining the System Requirement Specification.
4.All the methods inside the Interface are by default public and abstract.
5.All the Variable inside the Interface are also static and final by default
6.A concrete class can be inherited from interface by using the keyword 'implements'.
7.A class can implements multiple inheritance.
8.Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.


*Abstract Class
1.Abstract class is a special type of class in java that cannot be instantiated and contains
 both abstract and concrete methods.
2.Abstract can be defined by using the keyword 'abstract'.
3.Abstract class can also be used for System Requirement Specification.
4.Inside the Interface we can define the methods by using following Access Modifier:-
  public,default,protected and private.
5. Inside the Interface we can define any type of variables such as static,instance,final etc.   
6. Abstract class can be Inherited by using the keyword 'extends'.
7. An concrete subclass can extends only one abstract class.
8. An Abstract class can provide the implementation of one or many interface
